== README

This repository tracks changes while upgrading a Rails 4.x app to Rails 6.

This was done using staging from 4.2 -> 5.2 and finally to Rails 6.

Some issues in the Rails 5.2 app were not fixed until tested with rails 6
due to some gem version incompatibilities.

Changes were logged in separate commits (see commit comments in the log).
